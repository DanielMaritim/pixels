# pixels

A simple repo about not using pixels to make a website responsive

Why should we consider pixels? Why are many developers shying away from using pixels for font sizes

Pixels are fixed-size units that are used in screen media and they tend not to change when responsiveness on the web is needed

They are static and properties such as margins, padding and line-height do not scale on their own
